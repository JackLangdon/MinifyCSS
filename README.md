# MinifyCSS
A Java script for minifying a .css file

### Running from the Terminal:

1. Save script as "minifyCSS.java".
2. Locate script directory in Terminal and run $ java minifyCSS.java
3. File path will start from the script directory. I.e.: If you place the script in the same folder as your CSS file, the input file path will simply be "styles.css", or whatever you named your CSS file.
4. Same logic for output file path. I.e.: Entering output path as "styles.min.css" will create a new, minified CSS file in the same directory.
